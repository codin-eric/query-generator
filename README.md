# Query Builder
I needed a way of creating queries for dummies so I came up with this idea.

TODO:
- [X] load columns in filter
- [X] Download button
- [X] try checkboxes on select
- [ ] Save templates?
- [ ] Parse filters
- [ ] Download to gcs and access?

- [ ] Agregations in select? Like `SELECT 1, SUM(2), AVG(3) FROM table GROUP BY 1`
- [ ] Implement Hyper Modern
- [ ] Connect with DB

Wont do:    
- Join logic: This MVP will only query from final datamart
